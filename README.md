The QP examples support the efm3232pg1a (SLSTK3401A)

I did a very dirty port for the efm3232pg12b (SLSTK3402A)

This repository is [qpcpp](https://github.com/QuantumLeaps/qpcpp) from Quantum Leaps with all the changes I made to run on the SLSTK3402A.

You only need to have this repository and the [QP-Tools](https://github.com/QuantumLeaps/qtools/releases) installed (for make and the arm-gcc) on C:\qp\qtools.

There is a [windows batch](SLSTK3402A/windows_gnu_build_all.cmd) file which compiles all SLSTK3402A projects.
Two projects still have compile errors.

Again: The port is a hack - but the applications run ok.
